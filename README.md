### This repo is my attempt to:

* Structure and organize key concepts in computer vision into a coherent learning path.
* Bridge theory and practice by turning textbook formulas into code, visualizations, and intuitive explanations.
* Demonstrate practical use of these methods by applying them to real-world images and datasets.
* Deepen my own understanding through implementation and experimentation.

### This repo is **NOT** my attempt to:

* Replace a comprehensive computer vision textbook or course.
* Build a production-ready or performance-optimized library.
* Showcase state-of-the-art deep learning models â€” the focus is on classical methods and foundations.
